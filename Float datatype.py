""""As we mentioned earlier, in Python, you don't need to explicitly specify the type of a variable during declaration.
The type is inferred based on the type of value assigned to it.

Write a program which does the following:

Find the area of a circle whose radius is 8.9 cm. Take pi = 3.14
Declare variables radius , pi and area and assign the relevant values to them
Output area
Note: Area of a circle is Pi \times {radius}^2"""


pi=3.14
r=8.9
area=pi*r*r)
print(area)
